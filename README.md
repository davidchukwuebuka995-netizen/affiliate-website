## 📝 Customization Guide

### Change Site Name & Branding

**Edit in CSS (`style.css`):**
- Update color variables at the top:

  :root {
    --primary-color: #YOUR-COLOR;
    --primary-dark: #YOUR-DARK-COLOR;
  }
  ```

### Add Your Own Product Reviews

Create a new file in `posts/` folder (copy one of the sample posts):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Your Product Review Title</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Your description">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Copy header & footer from sample posts -->
  <!-- Write your content -->
</body>
</html>
```

Then link to it from `blog.html` in the grid section.

### Add Images

1. Add images to `assets/images/` folder
2. Reference them in your HTML:
```html
<img src="../assets/images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description">
```

**Optimize images:**
- Keep images under 100KB when possible
- Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics
- Tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh

```html
<nav>
  <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="blog.html">Blog</a>
  <a href="your-page.html">Your Page</a>
</nav>
```

## 🔗 Adding Affiliate Links

### Format for affiliate links:

```html
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/PRODUCT-ID" class="btn btn-primary">

</a>
```

Always include affiliate disclosure:

```html
<div class="disclosure">
  <strong>⚠️ Affiliate Disclosure:</strong> We earn commissions from products recommended. This doesn't affect your price.
</div>
```

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

# Visit: http://YOUR-IP:8000
```

     window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
     function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
     gtag('js', new Date());
     gtag('config', 'GA_ID');
   </script>
   ```

2. **Submit to Google Search Console** — Helps your site appear in Google results

3. **Create Social Media Accounts** — Promote your reviews on Twitter, Instagram, etc.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Links not working?**
- Check file paths are correct (use `../` to go up directories)
- Make sure filenames match exactly (case-sensitive on some servers)

**Page looks broken on mobile?**
- Open DevTools (F12) and toggle device toolbar
- Check that CSS file is loading (should say 200 in Network tab)

**Not appearing in Google?**
- Wait 2-4 weeks for indexing
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- Ensure pages have good content (200+ words minimum)
