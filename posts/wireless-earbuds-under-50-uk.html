      <h2>What to Look for in Budget Earbuds</h2>

      <h3>Sound Quality</h3>
      <p>Under £50, you won't get studio-quality sound, but you should expect balanced, clear audio suitable for music and calls. Look for earbuds with at least 5.8mm drivers.</p>

      <h3>Battery Life</h3>
      <p>Minimum 5 hours per charge is acceptable; 8+ hours is excellent. Don't forget the charging case—it typically provides 24-32 additional hours.</p>

      <h3>Noise Cancellation</h3>
      <p>Budget ANC is passable for trains and offices but won't match premium models. If you need strong ANC, expect to spend more.</p>

      <h3>Comfort & Fit</h3>
      <p>You'll wear these for hours. Look for multiple ear tip sizes and lightweight designs. Check reviews mentioning comfort for extended wear.</p>

      <h3>Water Resistance</h3>
      <p>IPX4 or better protects against sweat and light rain. Essential if you'll use them during exercise.</p>

      <h2>Budget Earbuds FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Do I need to spend more than £50 for good earbuds?</h3>
      <p>Not necessarily. These three options prove you can get excellent earbuds under £50. You'll find even better options at £80-150, but for casual listening and calls, these are perfect.</p>

      <h3>How long do cheap earbuds last?</h3>
      <p>Most quality budget earbuds last 2-3 years with daily use. Premium brands like JBL often offer longer support and warranty coverage.</p>

      <h3>Are wireless earbuds safe to use?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Wireless earbuds use Bluetooth, which operates at very low power levels and is safe for extended use. No special precautions needed.</p>

      <h3>Can I use them for working out?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if they have IPX4+ water resistance. All three of our picks are suitable for exercise and light rain. The Soundcore has the best ANC for busy environments.</p>

      <h3>Do they work with both iOS and Android?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Bluetooth is universal. All earbuds work with iPhones, Android phones, and any Bluetooth-enabled device.</p>

      <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
      <p>You don't need to spend a fortune for great wireless earbuds. The Soundcore Space A40 is our top pick—it's the best balance of features and price. If you want pure JBL sound, go for the Tune Buds. And if you're on a tight budget, the Anker P3i proves you can save money without sacrificing quality.</p>
