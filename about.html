<!-- ===== ABOUT SECTION ===== -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="article">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Alright Mate Reviews is an independent product review platform dedicated to helping UK consumers find the best products on the market. We believe that buying decisions should be based on thorough testing and honest assessments—not marketing hype.</p>
      <p>Our team consists of product experts, researchers, and writers who are passionate about helping people spend their money wisely. Every review published on our site has been carefully researched and tested.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We're on a mission to become the most trusted source for product recommendations in the UK by:</p>
      <ul class="indent-list">
        <li><strong>? Testing thoroughly</strong> — We don't just read spec sheets. We test products hands-on before recommending them.</li>
        <li><strong>? Being transparent</strong> — We clearly disclose all affiliate relationships and financial interests.</li>
        <li><strong>? Staying independent</strong> — We're not owned by retailers or manufacturers. Our only loyalty is to our readers.</li>
        <li><strong>? Focusing on value</strong> — We help readers find products with the best price-to-quality ratio.</li>
        <li><strong>? UK-first approach</strong> — All reviews account for UK availability, pricing, and delivery times.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
      <p>Alright Mate Reviews is supported by affiliate commissions. When you click through to purchase a product from our recommendations, we may earn a commission from the retailer. This commission does not affect the price you pay—it's our way of being compensated for our research and recommendations.</p>

      <h2 id="affiliate">Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <div class="disclosure">
        <strong>FTC & ASA Compliance:</strong> We comply with UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and US FTC guidelines for affiliate marketing transparency.
      </div>

      <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We earn commissions</strong> when you purchase through our links—but you pay the same price as buying directly</li>
        <li><strong>Your purchases don't cost you extra</strong> — Retailers pay our commission, not you</li>
        <li><strong>We disclose all relationships</strong> — Every product link is clearly marked as an affiliate link</li>
        <li><strong>Honest opinions</strong> — We review products we actually believe in. We won't recommend something just for commission</li>
        <li><strong>You can choose not to use our links</strong> — You're free to search for products independently</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Review Process</h2>
      <h3>1. Research</h3>
      <p>We identify products that are popular and relevant to UK shoppers. We read customer reviews, compare specifications, and understand the market.</p>

      <h3>2. Testing</h3>
      <p>We purchase and test products ourselves (or arrange test units from manufacturers). We evaluate performance, durability, value for money, and user experience.</p>

      <h3>3. Comparison</h3>
      <p>We compare products against competitors in the same category, highlighting pros and cons for each option.</p>

      <h3>4. Writing</h3>
      <p>Our writers create detailed, easy-to-read reviews that help you understand whether a product is right for you.</p>

      <h3>5. Transparency</h3>
      <p>We clearly mark affiliate links and disclose our relationships with retailers.</p>

      <h2>Affiliate Partners</h2>
